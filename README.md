# PayProX
A secure, scalable payment gateway ecosystem built with microservices and MongoDB Atlas.



## 🧭 Overview

The *PAYMENT-GATEWAY* project is a full-stack, production-grade simulation of a real-world digital payment ecosystem. It models the complete lifecycle of a transaction—from merchant order creation to customer payment authorization, fraud detection, settlement, and refund handling—using a modular microservices architecture.

Built with scalability, security, and recruiter-readiness in mind, this system separates concerns across dedicated services for acquirer and issuer banks, customer and merchant management, risk evaluation, tokenization, and settlement orchestration. Each service is independently deployable, internally authenticated, and professionally documented for onboarding and collaboration.

Key features include:

- 🔐 *Tokenization of card data* for secure credential handling  
- ⚠ *Real-time fraud detection* via a stateless risk engine  
- 💸 *T+2 settlement logic* for merchant payouts  
- 📡 *Global socket architecture* for instant UI updates  
- 🧱 *Modular backend services* with internal APIs and observability  
- 🧾 *Refund workflows* with merchant-side approval and execution  
- 🛠 *Frontend and merchant dashboards* for seamless UX

Whether you're a recruiter reviewing backend craftsmanship or a developer exploring scalable payment architecture, this project demonstrates how to build secure, traceable, and maintainable systems from the ground up.
